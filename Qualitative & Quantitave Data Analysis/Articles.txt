CARACAS, Aug. 12 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez on Friday concluded his
working visits to three countries of the Common Market of the South (Mercosur) aiming at
enhancing bilateral relations and promoting Latin American integration.
During the three-day visit to Uruguay, Argentina and Brazil, Chavez signed with his
counterparts a series of bilateral political and economic agreements.
Under the agreements signed with his Uruguayan counterpart, Tabare Vazquez, Venezuela is
to provide low-price crude oil for refining at Uruguayan refineries for 25 years. The processed
oil will be used to meet Uruguay's energy needs with the surplus to be exported to South
American countries.
Joint exploitation will take place in one of the reserve blocs Venezuela has in the eastern
petroleum strip, where there are proven reserves of 300 billion barrels of crude.
In return, Uruguay will export a large amount of agricultural, telecommunications and service
products to Venezuela.
Other joint efforts in the program include plans for an alcohol distillation project with
Uruguay near its northeastern border with Brazil and a cement plant which will export from
Uruguay to Venezuela 10 million US dollars worth of cement annually.
During his visit on Aug. 11 to Argentina, the second leg of the tour, Chavez signed with his
colleague Nestor Kirchner a series of agreements worth over 500 million dollars.
